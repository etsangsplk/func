# Introduction

This text is about a tool for building **virtual graphs**.

The library is primarily based on functions,
all data structures in the API are immutable and
the main data structure `build.Virtual` is implemented
as a `struct` containing five `func` pointers.

The text comes with two [Go][golang] packages:

- [github.com/yourbasic/graph][graph]
  is a library of basic graph algorithms and
- [github.com/yourbasic/graph/build][graphbuild]
  is the tool for building virtual graphs.

### Petersen graph

Let's start with an example, the Petersen graph:

To describe this graph in your typical graph library,
you need to somehow enter the edges  
{0, 1}, {0, 4}, {0, 5}, {1, 2}, {1, 6}, {2, 3}, {2, 7}, {3, 4},
{3, 8}, {4, 9}, {5, 7}, {5, 8}, {6, 8}, {6, 9}, and {7, 9}.

If you ask a mathematcian to describe the Petersen graph,
her answer would clearly be very different. Perhaps she would
say that the Petersen graph is most commonly drawn as a pentagon
with a pentagram inside, with five spokes.

```go
pentagon := build.Cycle(5)
pentagram := pentagon.Complement()
petersen := pentagon.Match(pentagram, build.AllEdges())
```
*Example from [godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/graph/build][graphbuilddoc].*

Virtual graphs are constructed by **composing** and **filtering**
a set of **standard graphs**, or by writing
**functions that describe the edges** of a graph.
